rogueportal (1.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Tested with Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian version: 11 (bullseye)
  * Split nginx configuration into two files to separate the captive portal site
    from the content site. This allows for easier customization of the content
    site.

rogueportal (1.3) buster; urgency=medium

  * Added support for RFC 8910 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8910)
    captive portal detection.
  * Added support for the go.rogueportal domain name and set this as the name
    used for the RFC 8910 captive portal URI. Also made this the redirect target
    for systems not supporting RFC 8910.
  * Changed nginx configuration to differentiate between a captive portal 
    request and other requests by whether the request includes the server name
    go.rogueportal. Removed the /letsconnect folder because it is no longer
    used to differentiate the requests.

rogueportal (1.2) buster; urgency=medium

  * Updated configuration to use dhcpcd instead of /etc/network/interfaces
  * Configuration no longer requires a bridge, so bridge-utils is no longer a
    package dependency.
  * The rogue portal is now configured for wlan0 only, allowing it to work
    alongside another network connection. So, for example, you can now have the
    rogue portal running on wlan0 and still ssh into the pi via a wired
    connection.
